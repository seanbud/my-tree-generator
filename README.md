# my-tree-generator
This project is a Blender 3D plugin used to generate base meshes of trees; these meshes will be modified to be used in other projects.


This is still a new project, and I plan to update this page. TODO.

Currently the plugin exists as a seperate script called 'my-tree-generator.py', and it's setup to be run inside the 'my-tree-generator.blend' file.


## Current State of Development Progress-
able to generate something that kinda-looks like a tree as a silhouette. still needs a lot of work.
